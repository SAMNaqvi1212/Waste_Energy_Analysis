## Introduction
Waste Generation across cities is growing day by day. With the growing population the waste generation is also rapidly increasing in its quantities. This waste generation has given birth to a lot of problems across communities giving rise to many different diseases, global warming and environmental pollution. The need of the hour is to treat the waste generated so that increase waste quantities can be prevented. One such suitable method is to produce electricity from waste; this not only would reduce the waste but also give us cheaper electricity at a very suitable rate. 

## Case-Study
In this case-study we have analysed the waste generation across the whole Germany. The data was observed from different of sources however, major source of data was Genesis database which provided the major chunk of data regarding the waste generation across Germany. The waste generation across the whole lot of Germany was observed and then different results were concluded from it about the feasibility regarding the production of electricity across different states in Germany. 

## Methodology
- The data was gathered from different sources and compiled in a Excel sheet. 
- The data was sorted out and put into a proper sturcutred manner in the Excel. 
- The data was cleaned, preprocessed and feature engineering was performed onto the dataset to extract useful features using Python.
- Feature importance was estimated for the target variable which was "Total Waste Generation" using Random Forest algorithm.
- Finally the data was visualized using Microsoft PowerBI. 

## Results and Evaluation 
It was estimated that Nordrhein-Westfalen had the most waste generated. Domestically generated waste exceeded way more than the waste that was brought from abroad. 
Also, the waste was major result of industrial constituents. 

## Conclusion
Hence the conclusion was made that waste can be a viable source of electricity if it is properly utilized and the management of waste is done effectively.
